    "There is a very clear way to define a strategy for this game. The first round, we have an even 50% chance of guessing correctly because there are two red and two black cards. To minimize variance, let's keep our first round wager to $0 since any amount doesn't increase our expected value. For the second round, it seems like we would want to bet, since we have a 2/3 chance of winning. If the first card is black, we guess red since two of the three remaining cards are red and vice versa if the first card is red. So, it seems like it would be advantageous to bet some amount of money during that round. How much is unclear (that's what we'll find out). The rest of the game is pretty straightforward. If two cards of the same color are drawn on the first two turns, we bet all of our money on each of the last two turns, getting 100 percent returns since we know the colors of the last two cards. If we draw one card of each color in the first two turns, we refrain from making a wager on the third turn, since we have another 50-50 coin flip and want to reduce variance, and bet everything on the final coin flip. Sound complicated? Let's try it out."
